# PaymentService
This document provides a thorough implementation and architectural design of DTU Pay,
which offers a mobile payment option for transactions between customers and merchants.
The system ensures secure token-based payments, account management, and reporting
capabilities.
DTU Pay is built on a microservice architecture, whilst employing REST and SOAP interfaces
whilst ensuring modularity through Docker containers and message queues.
This report details the event storming process, system architecture, design decisions, func-
tionality realization, and a description of project collaboration.
